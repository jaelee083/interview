    <span class="in">Reporter:</span>
    When we hear the impressions of players who've finished MOTHER 2, there's been a great 
    response overall. We check online game forums pretty often, and there's a lot of good 
    things written.<br><br>

    <span class="inc">Itoi:</span>
    I'm so glad to hear that. Since the internet is a closed-in area, people can really 
    run their mouths off, y'know? When MOTHER came out, a lot of people were picking apart 
    all its faults. I almost thought, well, I'm already a goner to these people — but since 
    MOTHER 2 was so well-received, I'm satisfied that I've finally gotten across what I 
    wanted to.<br><br>

    <span class="in">Reporter:</span>
    The only thing that was hard was when it would start lagging and everything slowed 
    down.<br><br>

    <span class="inc">Itoi:</span>
    Yeah, the over-processing.<br><br>

    <span class="in">Reporter:</span>
    But I'm sure that means you absolutely insisted on keeping the rest, even if it 
    weighed down that aspect of it.<br><br>

    <span class="inc">Itoi:</span>
    If I hadn't cared so much I wouldn't have been allocating everything with such 
    horrible balance, with the limitless character counts and eight megabits (out of 24) 
    of sound alone [laughs].<br><br><br>

    <span class="sp">
    <img src="r1.gif"><img src="r2.gif"><img src="r3.gif"><img src="r4.gif"><img src="r5.gif">
    </span><br><br>

    <span class="in">Reporter:</span>
    Your attention to the sound is amazing. How much of a say did you have in it?<br><br>

    <span class="inc">Itoi:</span>
    It's all because of the people who had far more of a read on it than I ever could. 
    [Music: Keiichi Suzuki, Hirokazu Tanaka] They basically put it together and told me 
    okay, here's the intro music. Then the person in charge of the sound was extremely 
    particular on the text scrolling speed and the length of the pauses put between lines 
    and such. I started wondering if we were running into programming bugs because he kept 
    sending stuff back to me. I'd just pause and blurt out, “Sooo……?” [laughs].<br><br>

    <span class="in">Reporter:</span>
    That was a first, huh?<br><br><br>

    <img class="imp" src="e4.png"></a><br><br>

    <span class="inc">Itoi:</span>
    I got hounded on for some sound being really outdated or the text windows looking 
    really shabby! I'd start wondering what the heck he was talking about. If the words 
    within it weren't interesting, then it'd be pointless.<br><br>
    
    For example, say there's a tap faucet, and its “water” is video games. People are 
    going to sell that water in all kinds of ways, with one guy saying it produces 
    rainbow-colored water, another guy claiming red water, and still another saying it's 
    mint-flavored. At that point, aren't they basically selling “hardware-in-software”? 
    But all I want to drink is safe, delicious, plain old water. I mean, it's tap water. 
    You can drink as much as you want and not get sick of it, and if you're presumably 
    going to be drinking the next day, too, then it's better off without colors. That's the 
    kind of approach I had going into it.<br><br>
    
    But if modern games are pieces of art, then they're quickly evolving into realism. If 
    looking like a photograph is the standard for what is highly esteemed, then it's no 
    different from some lady praising a wall calendar from some bank.<br><br>
    
    Look at Chibi Maruko-chan. She doesn't take that long to draw, but it sells because it's 
    interesting, right? But if that series came to the Famicom, are people gonna complain the 
    graphics are too tiny? Yes, they are. [laughs] But when it comes to hopeless poverty like 
    that, I say live your life only alongside those who are poor. So to all the people who 
    love the rainbow-colored games they've bought before, well… all I can do is apologize 
    [laughs].<br><br><br>

    <img class="imp" src="e10.png"></a><br><br>

    <span class="in">Reporter:</span>
    When I was playing the game and reached the end, I was so upset that it was almost over. 
    But I suppose there are people who were dissatisfied with MOTHER 2 because it makes you 
    feel that way.<br><br>

    <span class="inc">Itoi:</span>
    Well, with that — children, for example, get really excited when you say hey, we're going 
    out for sushi! But even with sushi, there are yummy ones and bad-tasting ones. Adults 
    are the ones that are particular about which sushi they eat, but it's hard to get a kid 
    to see how delicious a sushi is when he's still ecstatic about getting to eat it in the 
    first place. When they want three pieces instead of five, then all you can say is “Hey! 
    You can go get your own dang sushi!”. I'm not some kind of merchant. I know I can't bring 
    myself to sell something just by doing what it takes to please everyone. So I'd just tell 
    people who want sushi and don't care what it is to go and eat whatever, then. Oh, but — my 
    sushi might end up just being a little ball of rice. I'm going for simplicity, after 
    all.<br><br>

    <span class="in">Reporter:</span>
    Did you have a drive to make a game that adults can enjoy?<br><br>

    <span class="inc">Itoi:</span>
    Yeah, of course. I mean, there are less and less adults playing the Final Fantasy 
    series. Plus, kids who play the Famicom are being called dorks by kids who don't 
    play the Famicom. Just like kids who like manga are told, “So you go to Comiket, 
    huh?”. and suddenly aren't popular anymore. So it's kind of my dream for kids who 
    play the Famicom to become popular.<br><br><br>

    <img class="im" src="e1.png"></a><br><br>

    <span class="in">Reporter:</span>
    A Famicom that popular kids play, too?<br><br>

    <span class="inc">Itoi:</span>
    Yeah, that! I think it's really critical.<br><br>

    <span class="in">Reporter:</span>
    It really is getting bad, isn't it?<br><br>

    <span class="inc">Itoi:</span>
    Like how band members are immediately popular just from being band members.<br><br>

    <span class="in">Reporter:</span>
    I see where you're coming from. Some stuffy artist out there will hear the music 
    from MOTHER 2 and say hey, that's pretty good, and that'll be one way of getting 
    into the game.<br><br>

    <span class="inc">Itoi:</span>
    Yeah, like, “Whoa, that's a fretless bass!”. So I want it to be like a game made 
    by a group of friends who grew up in the same culture. It's not always about finding 
    records that are awesome for having been pumped out by the production equipment of 
    [Japanese record company conglomerate] Being, Inc.<br><br>

    <span class="in">Reporter:</span>
    But what's interesting is the kids who listen to music like that are the only ones 
    that aren't even aware of structures like Being.<br><br>

    <span class="inc">Itoi:</span>
    If so, I'd like them to at least get a taste of the aura of Flipper's Guitar, or 
    something.<br><br>

    <span class="in">Reporter:</span>
    It is about the aura, isn't it? So which parts of MOTHER 2 were you particularly 
    careful about regarding aura?<br><br><br>

    <img class="imp" src="e3.png"></a><br><br>

    <span class="inc">Itoi:</span>
    I'd say… all of it. The story, but the script was the main focus. I've got characters 
    with a vivid reality to them, but the script lines that didn't seem very realistic 
    were very frustrating.<br><br>

    <span class="in">Reporter:</span>
    There are a lot of tricks in the script and other areas that are borderline breaking 
    the unwritten “standards” of games.<br><br>

    <span class="inc">Itoi:</span>
    That's not true — I'm following the rules [laughs].<br><br>

    <span class="in">Reporter:</span>
    Well, on top of having kept the standards, then.<br><br>

    <span class="inc">Itoi:</span>
    Yeah… for example, the adults in MOTHER 2 tell lies. Telling a lie in a game means that 
    the functionality of direction leading a player through the game becomes increasingly 
    unreliable. Even though everything would be fine if they'd just said “go that way”, 
    saying something like, “If… if you go that way… you won't like it”, puts the game 
    functionality in a tough spot. But realistically speaking, we're surrounded every day 
    of our lives by people who aren't entirely honest or straightforward. That means it'd 
    only make sense for someone like that to show up in a game — I see it as a given. The 
    people who say it “fits” are the ones that get it.<br><br><br>

    <img class="imp" src="e2.png"></a><br><br>

    <span class="in">Reporter:</span>
    Going back to the script, there are quite a few lines that make the player acutely 
    aware of their world outside the game. Was that intentional?<br><br>

    <span class="inc">Itoi:</span>
    It was intentional. There's no way I could express every little thing in a game. 
    Its world isn't exactly one of actual realism, so I'm barely able to maintain that 
    intention along with the standards of what is “just a game”. If you don't let out 
    some of the hot air once in a while, it's going to become really obvious how 
    suspicious it is. Then people will really say, well, it's just a game.<br><br>

    <span class="in">Reporter:</span>
    MOTHER 2 is generally about “fated heroes”. Thanks to that, the gap between fantasy 
    and reality is filled in strategically enough to quell any suspicions.<br><br>

    <span class="inc">Itoi:</span>
    I don't think there was any other way to do it.<br><br><br>

    <img class="imp" src="e5.png"></a><br><br>

    <span class="in">Reporter:</span>
    I had a feeling the cameraman was sort of serving that same purpose.<br><br>

    <span class="inc">Itoi:</span>
    Well, someone else had come up with new logic that made it an entirely natural 
    occurrence. I was really impressed by that [laughs].<br><br>

    <span class="in">Reporter:</span>
    Like you can't bring yourself to accept a “meta” world [laughs].<br><br>

    <span class="inc">Itoi:</span>
    Yeah, it's not meta. I didn't know what it would take to let that cameraman be 
    a part of that world. It's actually more childish to do it that way; it's more 
    pleasant to just leave it as meta.<br><br>

    <span class="in">Reporter:</span>
    So it's the thought that you can't accept?<br><br>

    <span class="inc">Itoi:</span>
    I guess.<br><br><br>

    <img class="imp" src="e9.png"></a><br><br>

    <span class="in">Reporter:</span>
    Final Fantasy is a world that flatly refuses this meta perspective, but even so, 
    everyone's fine with it because it parallels with another time. Were there any 
    reservations in using this same tactic with MOTHER 2?<br><br>

    <span class="inc">Itoi:</span>
    That's like having to choose whether it's more fun to be required to follow a 
    certain rhythm and chase things in order, or pull everything together all at once 
    and carry it onward to wherever feels right.<br><br>

    <span class="in">Reporter:</span>
    It's clear that you at least kept things short.<br><br>

    <span class="inc">Itoi:</span>
    I wanted to. I think there were more techniques I could have chosen from, though. 
    We were five years late, but if it'd taken ten years, then there would have been 
    even more to it. For example, if we could watch the things we'd done on a TV in a 
    hotel room, that'd be fascinating. If we had an unlimited supply of time and manpower, 
    we'd want to. But what I'd really like to try is something I was happy that [Satoshi] 
    Tajiri mentioned: “When I reached my first battle scene I finally remembered that this 
    was an RPG I'm playing”. Which means both the tone of the scenes and the controls are 
    that of an action game.<br><br>

    <span class="in">Reporter:</span>
    Oh, I get it. The controls are pretty similar.<br><br>

    <span class="inc">Itoi:</span>
    Yeah. And I think it'd be most interesting if it could all pass as that. After all, 
    action games are really luxurious; they don't have set standards. So a great deal 
    of MOTHER 2's framework is based on how fun I think it would be if Super Mario could 
    turn into an RPG with the graphics as-is.<br><br><br>

    <img class="imp" src="e6.png"></a><br><br>

    <span class="in">Reporter:</span>
    And it's that desire that resulted in the game's battle-entry method.<br><br>

    <span class="inc">Itoi:</span>
    If it's a really slow enemy, you can just run away. That part of the game-play is 
    an action game. Whether that can be applied to the whole thing, well… RPGs aren't 
    fun when the player with the best manipulation of the controller wins… there's still 
    a lot to figure out.<br><br>

    But we're still talking about games in the context of what we know as “games”, so I 
    think we need to take a closer look at it; if we remove the quirks and essences and 
    things that make it a “game”, stripped bare it is just programming within a ROM to be 
    played. It might be a bit of an adventure to get to that point, but if its visitor 
    hasn't abandoned it yet, then the world inside that ROM will only get more interesting. 
    In America the Famicom is called “Nintendo Entertainment System”, right? It doesn't 
    say one word about games. I'd like to apply that logic.<br><br>

    <span class="in">Reporter:</span>
    I don't quite get exactly what that would entail, but do you mean it would be 
    interactive in a way?<br><br>

    <span class="inc">Itoi:</span>
    Yes.<br><br>

    <span class="in">Reporter:</span>
    I figured.<br><br>

    <span class="inc">Itoi:</span>
    Miyamoto-san always hated RPGs, you know. He'd question whether battle scenes were 
    really all that necessary. “Why can't they just do rock paper scissors?” So I told 
    him that without it, the game would be over in the blink of an eye. It'd be really 
    passive, and without battles there would be no stress. There'd be no feeling of 
    accomplishment when moving forward.<br><br>

    <span class="in">Reporter:</span>
    So that's what that “essence” of the game is.<br><br><br>

    <img class="imp" src="e8.png"></a><br><br>

    <span class="inc">Itoi:</span>
    And to make it feel more firsthand, I put in the rolling HP meter, involved chase 
    scenes with monsters before entering battles, things like that. Even then, he 
    questioned whether battles were necessary.<br><br>

    <span class="in">Reporter:</span>
    That's because he was sick of the battles, and the first Dragon Quest had battles as 
    a major part of the game.<br><br>

    <span class="inc">Itoi:</span>
    If you go to a beer factory, there's beer that's still not ready, called “young beer”. 
    The alcohol content is low and it smells really strongly of barley. Everyone says it's 
    really good if you drink it cold, and marvels at how it's the starting point of a good 
    beer. [laughs] They just rant and rave about it. But if you turned that young beer 
    into a product and sold it, there's no way it would actually sell. [laughs] You can't 
    drink as much orange juice as you can beer, right? That's the downfall of young beer, 
    which is basically barley juice.<br><br>

    To make a long story short, I don't think I'd play a finished ROM without battles if 
    I knew the rest of the story and all that benefits it. But if you tell me to make one 
    that you'll play, I'll do my best! That's my goal! So it's a question of what stressor 
    could replace that of the battles.<br><br><br>

    <img class="imp" src="e11.png"></a><br><br>

    <span class="in">Reporter:</span>
    Also, the feeling that time has passed from the beginning of the game to the end is 
    because of the battles up until that point.<br><br>

    <span class="inc">Itoi:</span>
    Right? I've been thinking about that. It's a part of MOTHER 2. Not just extending 
    play time, but accentuating how important every moment is. When you put the Zombie 
    Paper in the tent, you've got to spend a night, right? It takes time for it to work, 
    and I'm not talking just a few moments. It needs to go through a process. It was my 
    dream for people to see that as enjoyable. I don't think it's impossible for games 
    to have a sense of speed come across through methods like that. So I'll do my best 
    to master that. I'll focus really hard on pulling it off well in 3.<br><br><br>
